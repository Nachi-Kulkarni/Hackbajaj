    * **OCR**: Integrate `pytesseract` into `document_processor.py`. Add logic to first attempt text extraction with `pdfplumber`, and if the text output is minimal (indicating a scanned document), use `pdf2image` to convert pages to images and then process them with Tesseract.

    * In `models/document.model.js`, add new fields for `tags` (Array of Strings), `category` (String), and `version` (Number).
    * In `services/document.service.js`, implement full CRUD functionality: `updateDocument`, `deleteDocument`, and a `listDocuments` method that supports filtering by tags/category, sorting, and pagination.
    * Expose this new functionality through new controller methods in `controllers/document.controller.js` and corresponding routes (`GET /documents`, `GET /documents/:id`, `PATCH /documents/:id`, `DELETE /documents/:id`) in `routes/document.routes.js`.

    * **Scheduled Jobs**: Install `node-cron`. Create `jobs/scheduledAnalysis.job.js` to set up a cron job that runs periodically (e.g., daily) to perform maintenance tasks or re-analyze documents.

    * Before hitting the main vector database, query a separate, smaller cache (e.g., in Redis or an in-memory FAISS index) that stores embeddings of previously asked questions.
    * If a semantically similar question is found in the cache, the backend can be notified to use the cached response, bypassing the expensive LLM generation step.

* **Objective**: Prepare the system for high-scale deployment.
* **Service**: `üåêbackend_api` (Node.js)

    * Update the `ecosystem.config.js` file for PM2. Change the `exec_mode` to `cluster`.
    * Set the `instances` property to `0` or `'max'`, which tells PM2 to automatically create a worker process for each available CPU core on the machine, enabling horizontal scaling on a single server.

---
#### **Backend Engineer Ticket: BE-D7-002: Advanced Monitoring & Analytics**
* **Objective**: Create comprehensive system observability.
* **Service**: `üåêbackend_api` (Node.js)
